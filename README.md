## How to run

These are the instructions on how to run our project, taking in account they are executed from the `build` folder, so
start by changing directory.

```shell
cd build
```

### Compile

To compile the project code, execute the following command.

```shell
make -C ../
```

### Start a peer

To start a peer's execution, execute the following command.

```shell
java Peer <peer_id> <address> <port>
```

### Test the application

To test the application, execute the following command.

```shell
java TestApp <access_point> <BACKUP|RESTORE|DELETE|RECLAIM|STATE|JOIN> [operand_1 [operand_2]]
```

Alternatively, each peer's has a permanent while loop waiting to receive commands.

```shell
<BACKUP|RESTORE|DELETE|RECLAIM|STATE|JOIN|ST> [operand_1]
```

**Note:** Additionally, an `st` command was added to check the Chord's state.
